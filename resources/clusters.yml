# NO INTERACTIVE CLUSTERS - All compute uses JOB CLUSTERS only
# This file is intentionally minimal to avoid creating interactive clusters
#
# Cost Optimization:
# - DLT pipelines create their own job clusters (configured in pipelines.yml)
# - dbt jobs use job_cluster_key (configured in jobs.yml)
# - No always-on interactive clusters = significant cost savings
#
# Job cluster config is defined inline in jobs.yml
